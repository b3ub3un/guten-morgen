Player
Weapons cards
2 one handed or 1 two handed
1 secondary
Soldiers cards
1 captain
unlimited soldiers
Buffs cards
unlimited buffs

--> captain = player? (different captain cards like the race and class in munchkin?)
--> how many cards in hand?
--> add forbidden cards like "PQ --> not usable by Helmut" or "slibeur --> not usable by beun if we are the 19/09"

Possible actions during a turn
duel another Player (player 2)
punchline fight (frank wins) OR singing battle OR 1v1 any other stupid game --> masterclass idea. Should set a defined list of minigames in order to not wait 10 min to find a random game
in case of win
can pick a card from the loser (player 2)
OR
can fight a monster (detaisl below) --> not enough reward, the game will be to long, especially if the players can help monsters
in case of lost
winner (player 2) can add a rule concerning the loser (player 1) after the neutral players vote if the rule is ok --> it is in neutral players interest to vote yes on a bad bad rule for the loser : create a fair system
OR
can pick a card from the loser (player 1)
fight a monster (randomly generated, like on munchkin)
other players can help him or the monster (player's power divided by 2 when helping a monster)
in case of win
gets a card (still like on munchkin, depending on the level of the monster) --> winning first game and winning battle against monster = same as winning first game and taking card
in case of lost
loose some of his cards randomly --> ref luf game: take 3 cards, shuffle them and set them face down. The looser takes 1 card and if its the lowest, he looses 3 cards, if its the highest, only 1 card,...
request a fight with the boss
the boss monster spawns
you have to fight it
the player deafeating him wins the game
loosing against the boss results in having a pledge
noone can help the player
everyone can help the boss --> better to make a really badass boss but noone can help him?
the boss's level is set before the game start (the highest the level, the longest the game) --> yes. game duration is adaptable

The next playing player is decided by a game (the player finishing his turn choose the game to play):
Do not laugh
no more comments --> great idea.
OR
A shit like undercover idk how to name it
all players have an assertion (like "You are gay" (player 1), "You love eating chocolate" (player 2), "Your name is John" (player 3))
lying is forbidden
one after the others, players can choose to ask a question to another player or try guessing what their assertion is
when a player guess right, he gets a card
the player that has kept his assertion secret wins and can play a turn
a player cannot try guessing when its not his turn
OR
Any other shit you can think about --> decided by a "qui a dit?"

To decide who will start the first turn of the game, all players have to tell a joke, the best one starts the game (decided by vote, self-voting is forbidden) --> yes but vote the worst one ?
